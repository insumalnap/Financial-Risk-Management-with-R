# Financial Risk Management with R
This repository contains the implementation of financial risk management techniques learned in the "Financial Risk Management with R" course offered by Duke University on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-risk-management-with-r).

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to apply the concepts learned in the course and demonstrate proficiency in using R for financial risk management.

## Techniques Covered
The course covers various techniques to quantify the market risk of a portfolio, including:

- Retrieving data from the FRED database of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
- Calculating arithmetic and log returns
- Testing for normality
- Calculating Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) when returns are normally distributed
- Calculating VaR and ES when returns are not normally distributed
- Testing for the presence of serial correlation and volatility clustering
- Calculating VaR and ES when returns exhibit volatility clustering
